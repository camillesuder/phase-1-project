Hello, this website is an introduction to The Care Bears and the Care Bear Cousins. 
It features photos of these creatures along with information about them such as their name, Belly Badge, and where they live. 
Users may add their own Care Bear and give 'likes' to Care Bears they enjoy. Have fun exploring my site!
